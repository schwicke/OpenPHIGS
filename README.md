# OpenPHIGS

This repository is based on OpenPHIGS from

https://sourceforge.net/projects/phigs/files/

which is based on

https://www.x.org/archive/unsupported/lib/PHIGS

This distribution contains modifications and extensions which are needed for the purpose of data preservation in high energy physics.
The code maturity level is pre-alpha, since it does not implement the full standard, neither for the C bindings, nor for Fortran.

## Building

Run
```
make
make install
```
which will create and install the OpenPHIGS library, headers and tests in a new subdirectory called distrib. The install step will create a folder called distrib, including headers, binaries and libraries.

### Switching between GLEW and Epoxy
Openphigs uses by default GLEW. Switching between GLEW and Epoxy is supported by configuring with -DUSE_GLEW=0. The Makefile checks for the environment variable NO_GLEW. If defined, it will use Epoxy, else GLEW. To switch to Epoxy, do
```
NO_GLEW=1 make
```

### Switching between Xaw and Motif Widgets
By default, widgets will use Motif. To switch to Xaw, make sure that cmake is configure without the -DMotif switch. Take a look at the top level CMakeLists.txt file

## Extensions
Some extensions have been implemented, specifically for the Fortran bindings, to support the DELPHI and OPAL event displays.

#### Fortran bindings:
The second argument of popwk expects a non-zero integer which will be passed on as LUN.

* If a file name has been defined in the configuration file as  %wf <filename>, the targa file will be created with this name in the current folder.
* If no file name has been defined in the configuration file as %wf <filename> fort.<LUN> will be used.
* After opening the work station, the output file name can be set with a call to CALL PSFNAME(WKD, <filename>) where filename can be the full path to the output

#### C bindings

* If a file name has been defined in the configuration file as  %wf <filename>, the targa file will be created with this name in the current folder.
* If no file name has been defined in the configuraiton file, it defaults to "output.tga" and is created in the current directory.

## Migration notes and extensions
Some notes on differences with respect to other implementations.

### Workstation numbers
Workstation numbers can be in the range from 0 to 99.

### Workstation types
* 0  PWST_OUTPUT_TRUE                 Output only on GL display
* 1  PWST_OUTIN_TRUE                  Input/Output on GL display
* 2  PWST_OUTPUT_TRUE_DB              Output only on GL, buffered
* 3  PWST_OUTIN_TRUE_DB               Input/Output on GL display, buffered
* 4  PWST_HCOPY_TRUE_TGA              Hardcopy to file as TGA
* 5  PWST_HCOPY_TRUE_RGB_PNG          Hardcopy to file as PNG RGB only
* 6  PWST_HCOPY_TRUE_RGBA_PNG         Hardcopy to file as PNG with Alpha channel
* 7  PWST_HCOPY_TRUE_EPS              Hardcopy to file as Encapsulated PostScript, no shaders
* 8  PWST_HCOPY_TRUE_PDF              Hardcopy to file as PDF, no shaders
* 9  PWST_HCOPY_TRUE_SVG              Hardcopy to file as SVG, no shaders
* 10 PWST_HCOPY_TRUE_OBJ              Export geometry as OBJ
* 11 PWST_HCOPY_TRUE_GLTF             Export geometry as glTF

Notes:
 * The hardcopy types are available in Fortran. C-Bindings have not been tested with them

### Input devices
Openphigs behaviour on echo modes is summarized below.

#### String echo modes
* echo mode 1
  * opens a new window
  * echo area given in NC coordinates for the root window
* echo mode -1
  * echo area given in % relative to the main window

#### Valuator echo modes
* echo mode 1:
  * uses default strings for label, format low label and high label
  * opens a new window
  * echo area given in NC coordinates for the root window
* echo mode -1: As mode 1 but expects additional parameters as string, namely
  * label
  * format
  * low label
  * high label
  These should be encoded

Extensions:
* echo mode 2:
  * as echo mode 1 but places the window on top of the main window
  * echo area given as a fraction of the main window
* echo mode -2:
  * as echo mode -1 but places the window on top of the main window
  * echo area given as a fraction of the main window
* echo mode 3, -3:
  * as echo mode 2 but places the window on top of the main window
  * echo area given as a fraction of the main window
  * boxes the valuators up in one Window.
  (!) PPREC expects one integer for this echo mode which is the number of valuators to be boxed up

#### Choice echo modes
* echo mode 1:
  * opens a new window
  * echo area given in NC coordinates for the root window
* echo mode -1:
  * displays window on top of the root window
  * echo area is given as a fraction of the root window
* echo mode 3:
  * opens a new window
  * echo area given in NC coordinates for the root window
  * expects titels as strings
* echo mode -3:
  * as 3 but
  * echo area is given as a fraction of the root window
* echo mode 4:
  * as 3 but expects one more string
  * last string will be used as title
* echo mode -4:
  * as 4 but
  * echo area is given as a fraction of the root window

## Transparency

### RGBA Color mode
This version supports colors with 4 components. To switch to this mode, use PMODEL_RGBA instead of PMODEL_RGB which is the default. This
can be done via a call to PSCM(WKID, COLORMODE). Note that this call should be done directly after the workstation has been opened.
Use

COLORMODE=0 for PINDIRECT
COLORMODE=1 for PMODEL_RGB
COLORMODE=2 for PMODEL_RGBA

### Default colors
To pre-define some colors you can use

CALL PXSCM(WKID)

In COLORMODE=1 create 125 colors starting with index 16. Any colors with lower indices will not be touched.
In COLORMODE=2 same as above. In addition, it will create 5 levels of transparent colors for all colors, with offset 200 with decreasing transparency. This is done as well for any existing colors with indices between 1 and 15.

## Extensions
### Fortran bindings
* PXNDEF(STRING NAME): set the configuration location and file name
* PXSHCSF(INTEGER IWK, REAL VALUE): Set hardcopy scale factor for workstation ID WKID. Must be set before the workstation is being opened.
* PXQHCSF(INTEGER IWK, REAL VALUE): Inquire the current scale factor for workstation ID WKID. The value is returned in the second argument.
* PSFNAME(INTEGER IWK, CHARACTER FNAME): set output file name for workstation ID IWK
* PXSCM(): Set color map
* PXOIRM(InTEGER IWK, INTEGER mode): OIR mode. 0=OIR disabled, >0 number of layers per pixel

### C-bindings
* pxset_conf_file_name(char* path): set the configuration location and file name
* pxset_conf_hcsf(int wkid, Pfloat value): Set hardcopy scale factor for workstation ID WKID. Must be set before the workstation is being opened
* Pfloat pxinq_conf_hcsf(int wkid): Inquire the current hardcopy scale factor for workstation ID WKID.
* pxset_color_map(int wkid): set color map
* pxset_oir_mode(int wkid, int mode): OIR mode. 0=OIR disabled, >0 number of layers per pixel

### Configuration file
By default, OpenPHIGS will look for a file named phigs.def in the current directly, and use it to apply default values. This is where you can set window names, backgrounds etc. Explanations can be found in the template shipped with the distribution.
