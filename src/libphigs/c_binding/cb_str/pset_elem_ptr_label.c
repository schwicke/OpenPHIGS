/**
 * \file pset_elem_ptr_label.c
 *
 * \brief       Searches forward in the structure list for the specified
 *      label, and makes that the current element.  Search begins
 *      with the element after (to the right) of the current one.
 *      Question: should I include the current element in the search?
 *      Or does the search begin with the first element after the
 *      current one?
 *      This version gives fatal error if label not found.
